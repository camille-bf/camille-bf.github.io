            1/ The first thing I noticed was that the cursor was an animated
            fly.

            2/ During the two minutes, I started to scroll, clicked on the About
            page, pressed the power button on the landing page, explored the
            Work page, clicked on the portoflio page interaction in the works
            page, viewed the projects, clicked on the Links page, and finally
            checked the Awards button.

          <p>
            3/ I spent the most time navigating between the About and Work pages
            because I wanted to see both the personal information and the
            showcased projects. These two pages were the ones that had the most
            content because its a portfolio page so its what people are the most
            interested in, skills and works.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            4/ In the two minutes experience, the most common actions were
            scrolling and clicking on everything that looked interactive.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            5/ My impression of the website is that it is a portoflio that
            showcases his skills, not just with the work or technical skills he
            shares, but rather through interaction and design of the website.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            6/ The interactive experience communicates this primary goal just
            from interacting that he is both a developer and a designer because
            of how clean layout is, the strong visual identity, and how coherent
            the design is.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            7/ The experience should be explored by clicking through all the
            pages in his portfolio to fully see his work and technical skills.
            Users should also take time to notice small interactive details—for
            example, hovering over the coffee cup triggers a subtle smoke
            animation. It takes around five minutes, or a little more, to
            interact with the entire website, which is usually enough to see and
            appreciate his design and development skills. If he adds new work
            over time, it’s worth revisiting the site.

        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            8/ The interactive experience communicates how it should be used
            through subtle signals, such as hover effects. For example, when you
            hover over the "About" page, the word becomes larger, inviting you
            to click on it. The animations also help guide the user, and the
            site is very structured, with a landing page, About page, Work page,
            Links page, and Awards page, making the navigation clear and
            intuitive for the users.

          <p>
            9/ the experience references from many different other media forms
            such as digital art for the illustrations, motion design because of
            the site’s animations, and of course UI elements that are
            interactive such as hover effect, scroll, clickable content.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            10/ The references communicate that I should be curious, explore
            everything that looks interactive, and take time to notice details
            and animations.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            11/ The references on the site communicate that I should feel
            curious, and engaged while interacting with the experience. The use
            of motion design, hover effects, interactive elements, and a
            coherent design makes the experience enjoyable and intuitive. The
            linear organization and structure of the content allows users to
            explore freely without fear of getting lost, encouraging
            experimentation and active participation.

            12/ The most frustrating part of the interaction is that, while the
            landing page is well organized and clear, the actual pages like
            "About" and "Work" could have been better structured. On the "Work"
            page, only one client project is showcased, while the other two
            works are his current portfolio and a 3D portfolio he is developing.
            There are at least two works that he could have logically added to
            his "Work" page. In the "About" page, his technical skills and
            awards are shown, but some links are not clickable or don’t lead
            directly to his work, which can be confusing. Additionally, the
            awards being listed in multiple places (in the about page and the
            awards page), makes it harder to fully understand his achievements
            and shows that the site’s structure could be improved.
          </p>

          <p>
            13/ The most satisfying part of the interaction is when the user
            opens the "About" or "Work" page, and the content is presented
            within an illustration of a computer. This is satisfying because it
            is an original concept that makes the portfolio feel interactive and
            immersive, and also reinforces the creativity of the designer’s work
            instead of a standard portfolio content. And when you click on a
            project in the "Work" page, you can interact with it as if it was
            the actual website of that portfolio which is also original and adds
            to the designer’s attention to detail. I also liked that when you
            click on the menu button top right, there is a hand animation
            appears and “pulls down” the menu from the top so that it appears.
            Moreover, on the landing page for “links” i find it satisfactory
            that badge notifications appears on the GitHub, LinkedIn and
            instagram icons when you hover over them. It highlights both the
            designer’s attention to detail and encourages the user to interact
            with the interface to find these little details that add to the
            experience.
